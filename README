# TODO:
- Natural space update still so bad
-> N-update seems to get stuck at some local optimum
-> batch elbo always evaluates to -inf (log 0) -> KL term??
-> same thing with S update -> 0
->  L gets updated to 0 vector -> shitty initialization
-> For natural update -> L gets negative

-> Check KL computations

- Implement L Carin's group's implementation for poisson likelihoods and binary likelihoods as well
-> Count prediction is still so bad
