# TODO:
- Implement Torch-SSVI : count tensor blowing up -> log pdf computation is problematic?

- Implement L Carin's group's implementation for poisson likelihoods and binary likelihoods as well
-> test RSME is not changing -> because the algorithm predicts the same number (confirmed)
-> S is not changing or t is not changin?
-> s_update is the same
-> s_cur is different each time (seemingly)



- Could I modify MCMC-SSVI to learn the weight vector for factorization model as well?
