# Command


# TODO:
- Update in the natural space, compute gradient with respect to the mean parameters and use that to update
-> That will involve compute the derivative with respect to the natural parameter of the ELBO and then
use it in the update (not just simply adding the gradient)
-> But first, need to nail down the math!!!!


- Implement L Carin's group's implementation for poisson likelihoods and binary likelihoods as well
-> Count prediction is still so bad
