# TODO:
- Natural space update still so bad
-> Note that there is a scaling factor in the update formula
-> Try keeping track of the changes in gradient and covariances


- Implement L Carin's group's implementation for poisson likelihoods and binary likelihoods as well
-> Count prediction is still so bad
