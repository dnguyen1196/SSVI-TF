# Problem with robust TF

- why d_cov always 0 -> implementation problem??

- the derivative is biased? what does it mean for the estimate to be biased? But we work
with the expectation??

- Try first looking at the case of complete conditionals

- Test on data that actually have noise! -> tensor.synthesize_data()


# other data types
- implement sample function

# Others
- sigma**2 vs just sigma (take note of this in current implementation)
- Implement function to compute the VLB
- Report RSME

# poisson prediction
- Look at Rishit's code
- Basically doing sampling -> algebraic transformation to avoid looping -> saves cost

# Questions: 
- Is it better to do approximation or sampling
