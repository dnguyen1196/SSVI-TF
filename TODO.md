# - Implement separation between H-MC-SSVI and S-MC-SSVI and N-MC-SSVI (mode)
- So there will be different options to do the update formula
- Implement as functions and chosen at runtime
- 

# Check the code for robust TF
- Reimplement the gradient computation according to the new formulas

# Fix poisson prediction
- Look at why the errors shoot up after reaching relatively low error rate 
(at least the error is not blowing up now :|)
- Look at the changes in norms
- Implement the more 'accurate' formulas for prediction lmao
- Look at the actual prediction that the algorithm outputs
- Send some report to Roni
