# Other data types
- Check old commits to see what went differently?
- Visually run through code
- Check formulation another time
- Problem with data generation?
- Check formulation of first log derivative, why is i sigmoid(y * m)

# Problem with robust TF



# other data types
- implement sample function

# Others
- sigma**2 vs just sigma (take note of this in current implementation)
- Implement function to compute the VLB
- Report RSME

# poisson prediction
- Look at Rishit's code
- Basically doing sampling -> algebraic transformation to avoid looping -> saves cost

# Questions: 
- Is it better to do approximation or sampling
