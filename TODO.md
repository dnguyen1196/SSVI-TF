# implement poisson likelihood
- How to do the expectation computation
- Do laplace approximation
- 

# Numerical estimation of other likelihood?
- For both poisson prediction and if we want to have closed form
for Di and di, then we need to do that ugly formula to approximate
the distribution over f_ijk
