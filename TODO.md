# implement poisson likelihood

# Numerical estimation of other likelihood?
- For both poisson prediction and if we want to have closed form
for Di and di, then we need to do that ugly formula to approximate
the distribution over f_ijk

# Fix poisson prediction
Why does it always predict 0
- Check derivative of log poisson
