# Check the code for robust TF
- The error is increasing, why?
  + Check the normal pdf + derivatives
  + d mean and d cov decreases for sure
  + More samples? -> seems not likely
  +  
  
- Do safe division with log

# Implement a common interface


# Have another implementation for suboptimal bound


# Implement function to do batch computations of derivatives


# Others
- sigma**2 vs just sigma (take note of this in current implementation)
- Implement function to compute the VLB


# poisson prediction
- Look at Rishit's code

# Questions: 
- Is it better to do approximation or sampling
