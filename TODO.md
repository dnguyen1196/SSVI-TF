- why is the decision rule m >= 1/2 and without using a link function
- Start with distribution.py
- Implement link function

# implement poisson likelihood

# Implement schaul-like scheme and see if it improves on 
adaGrad
-> Looks like OK 

# Implement adaDelta and see if gives better convergence speed than
AdaGrad
-> Looks like not
