# Other data types
- Implement function to do estimates by sampling -> both for bernoulli (with noise)
and poisson (<- most important?)
- First figure out the predictive integral

- Thought experiment: running simple model without noise prediction? Is it better than
deterministic model? ->
- Simple binary with sampling prediction -> same error forever?? wy

# Problem with robust TF
- Need to fix robust count 
- Robust binary and real seem to be working ? => just need more data to look at

Look at derivative for poisson case



# other data types
- implement sample function

# Others
- sigma**2 vs just sigma (take note of this in current implementation)
- Implement function to compute the VLB
- Report RSME

# poisson prediction
- Look at Rishit's code
- Basically doing sampling -> algebraic transformation to avoid looping -> saves cost

# Questions: 
- Is it better to do approximation or sampling
